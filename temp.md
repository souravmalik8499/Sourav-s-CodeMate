❌ Bad Code:
```javascript
function sum (){return a+b;}
```

🔍 Issues:
* ❌ `a` and `b` are undefined. The function `sum` doesn't declare or receive any input parameters. This will lead to
unexpected results (likely `NaN`).
* ❌ Missing JSDoc documentation for parameters and return

✅ Recommended Fix:

```javascript
/**
* Calculates the sum of two numbers.
* @param {number} a - The first number.
* @param {number} b - The second number.
* @returns {number} The sum of a and b.
*/
function sum (a, b){
return a + b;
}
```

💡 Improvements:
* ✔ The function now accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, making it reusable.
* ✔ Includes JSDoc to explain what the method does, including each parameter and the return.
* ✔ Returns the sum of the two input numbers.

Final Notes:
Always make sure your functions declare their parameters and have JSDoc. It improves readability and avoids errors
caused by undefined variables.
